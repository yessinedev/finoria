# Delivery Receipt Navigation Setup

## Overview
This document describes the setup of the delivery receipt feature with proper navigation integration. The test components have been removed and replaced with a proper standalone page and navigation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Test Components
- Deleted `TestDeliveryReceipt.tsx` component
- Deleted `/sales/test-delivery-receipt/page.tsx` route

### 2. Created Standalone Delivery Receipts Page
- Created `/delivery-receipts/page.tsx` as a standalone page
- This page uses the existing `Delivery` component from `components/sales/delivery.tsx`

### 3. Updated Navigation
- Added "Bon de livraison" to the "Gestion de ventes" section in the sidebar
- Updated `app-sidebar.tsx` to include the new navigation item
- Added `Truck` icon for the delivery receipts navigation item
- Updated the `NavigationItem` type to include "delivery-receipts"
- Updated the `getRoute` function to map "delivery-receipts" to "/delivery-receipts"

## Navigation Structure
The delivery receipts page is now accessible through:
- Main navigation: Gestion de ventes â†’ Bon de livraison
- Direct URL: /delivery-receipts

## Features Available
- View all delivery receipts in a table
- Create new delivery receipts from sales
- Download delivery receipts as PDF
- Delete existing delivery receipts
- Search and filter delivery receipts

## Implementation Details
The implementation follows the existing application patterns:
- Uses the same `Delivery` component that was previously used for testing
- Integrates with the existing delivery receipt database tables
- Maintains all functionality from the test version
- Follows the same styling and UI patterns as other sections

## Future Improvements
1. Add editing functionality for existing delivery receipts
2. Implement delivery status tracking (en route, delivered, etc.)
3. Add more advanced filtering and sorting options
4. Implement batch operations for delivery receipts
